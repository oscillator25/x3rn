# SensorDuck

The SensorDuck is a special type of DuckLink that has a specific sensor attached to itself. The purpose of the SensorDucks are to deliver data regarding its environment using the sensors attached to itself. The idea is to use sensors to detect any anomalies that indicate a possible disaster so we can be better prepared. There are few SensorDucks already created:

[BMP180](https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/tree/master/examples/BMP180Example): collects weather data such as temperature and pressure.

[BMP280](https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/tree/master/examples/BMP280Example): collects weather data such as temperature and pressure. \(upgrade from the BMP180\)

[GP2Y](https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/tree/master/examples/DustSensorExample): senses the air quality; how much dust in the air

[DHT11](https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/tree/master/examples/DHT11Example): senses the temperature and humidity in the air

\[MQ7\]: senses five different gases \(H2, LPG, CH4, CO, EtOH\)

\[ADXL335\]: measures the acceleration in the x, y, z direction
