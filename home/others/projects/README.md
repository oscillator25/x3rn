## Captive Portal

The Captive Portal is an important feature in the CDP. It is how the civilians can submit their emergencies when they communicate with the Ducks. When a civilian connects to a Duckâ€™s WiFi access point, a page pops up \(the Captive Portal\) where they answer a few questions regarding their emergencies. The major benefit of the Captive Portal allows devices such as smartphones and laptops to access networks without the need to download any software.
