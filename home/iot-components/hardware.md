# Hardware

The minimal hardware to create a Duck is a microcontroller with a LoRa board, a power source, a data transfer cable, and maybe an enclosure. There are many combinations of electronics, batteries, and enclosures that can be used. We recommend the following set of materials to create a functional Duck:

**Microcontroller with LoRa Board**: [Heltec ESP32 WiFi + LoRa board](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Development-Bluetooth-0-96inch-Display/dp/B076MSLFC9/ref=sr_1_5?crid=195NDMUSSG4JA&dchild=1&keywords=heltec+esp32&qid=1592916868&sprefix=heltec%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-5)

**Power Source**: [3.7V 1.25 Micro JST battery](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Rechargable-Protection-Insulated-Development/dp/B07CXNQ3ZR) \(1000 mAh\)

**Data Transfer Cable**: [USB Micro connector](https://www.amazon.com/Rankie-Micro-Charging-Braided-3-Pack/dp/B01JPDTZXK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RT8LSASFWFVS&dchild=1&keywords=usb+micro+cable+data&qid=1592917018&s=electronics&sprefix=usb+micro+cable+data%2Celectronics%2C143&sr=1-1)

**Enclosure**: Any plastic box \(or 3D print, or even a rubber ducky\). We made this special \[DuckLink Enclosure\] to print if you prefer
